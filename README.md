# Numerical Analysis of Van der Pol oscillators

Abstract: We present an analysis of Van der Pol oscillators, a class of nonlinear oscillatory systems. They are used to represent non-conservative, oscillating systems with non-linear damping. We will investigate the behavior of Van der Pol oscillators across different damping strengths, focusing on cases where the parameter 𝜇 is equal to zero, small (0 < 𝜇 ≪ 1), and large (1 ≪ 𝜇). Numerical solutions to these equations will provide insights into the dynamic behavior of Van der Pol oscillators and offer comparisons with other predictions. 

Keywords: Van der Pol oscillator, RLC circuit, non-linear damping
